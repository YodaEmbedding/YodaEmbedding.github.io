  TODO: may need to run JavaScript to actually get labels before they are defined...
  Do we have any other clever solutions? Perhaps the user specifies a delta label instead?
  And later, we assert that that delta was correctly chosen. :)
  This might be a bit too complicated for a simple website, though...
  Another option is to cache the labels between runs (inside Store), and tell the user to run hugo at least twice for correct labels... just like how LaTeX works.

{{- $label := .Get 0 -}}
{{- $labels := .Page.Scratch.Get "labels" -}}
{{- if (isset $labels $label) -}}
  {{- $figureCounter := index $labels $label -}}
  Figure {{ $figureCounter -}}
{{- else -}}
  <!-- <span class="error" style="color: red">Label not found</span> -->
  the figure below
{{- end -}}
